# IABC Website Redesign - The Nabooians

***
## Project Background & Business Need/Opportunity
  The IABC Regina chapter is an organization that strives to provide opportunities for its members to learn, grow, and connect with other communication professionals. Therefore, it is crucial for the IABC Regina chapter to have an accessible and appealing website that IABC members can use with ease. The IABC Regina chapter board members addressed concerns about the current limitations and problems being experienced with their website. 

These concerns include but are not limited to:
* the confusion caused by multiple locations and layers of navigation
* the confusion caused by duplicated information on the Regina chapter and international websites
* the lack of two-way communication and membership engagement
* the inability to accept payments for job posting through the website
* the amount of time and effort required to manage the website

The proposed improvements to address these concerns include but are not limited to:
* introducing a more simple and clean navigation structure
* directing users to the international website to reduce duplication
* introducing features such as a blog to increase engagement and communication
* introducing payment functionality to the website
* introducing a more simple back-end

A website redesign, both front-end and back-end, would improve IABC Regina members’ experiences when using the website and increase the amount of connection and learning opportunities. A negative experience when using the IABC Regina chapter website may result in users no longer visiting or engaging with the website, deeming any amount (even minimal amounts) of effort put forth by the website administrators a waste of time. Therefore, it is important that IABC Regina members’ experiences are a main consideration during the redesign process.
